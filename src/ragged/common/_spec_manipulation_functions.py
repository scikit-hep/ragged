            `N + axis + 1`. Hence, if provided -1, the resolved axis position
            is `N` (i.e., a singleton dimension is appended to the input array

        shape: A new shape compatible with the original shape. One shape
            dimension is allowed to be -1. When a shape dimension is -1, the
            corresponding output array shape dimension is inferred from the
            length of the array and the remaining dimensions.
        copy: Boolean indicating whether or not to copy the input array. If

        shift: Number of places by which the elements are shifted. If `shift`

    Joins a sequence of arrays along a new axis.
